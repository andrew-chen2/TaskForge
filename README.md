Here's a README file for the TaskForge scheduler:

# TaskForge

TaskForge is a decorator-based task scheduler designed for periodic and delayed task execution. It provides an easy way to schedule and manage tasks with support for pausing, resuming, stopping, and dynamically editing tasks. You can also group tasks together and apply time-based actions such as intervals, delays, and jitter.

## Features

- **Periodic Execution**: Schedule tasks to run periodically at fixed intervals.
- **Delayed Execution**: Schedule tasks to run once after a delay.
- **Pause, Resume, Stop**: Control task execution by pausing, resuming, or stopping tasks.
- **Dynamic Task Editing**: Edit task properties like intervals, delay, jitter, and groups dynamically.
- **Task Groups**: Organize tasks into named groups and execute all tasks within a group.
- **Jitter Support**: Add randomness to task intervals and delays for a more natural execution pattern.
- **Priority**: Placeholder for future priority management.

## Installation

TaskForge is available as a Python package. To install it, clone this repository or install it via pip:

```bash
pip install taskforge
```

## Usage

### Create an Instance of TaskForge

```python
from taskforge import TaskForge

scheduler = TaskForge()
```

### Defining Tasks

Use the `every()` and `after()` decorators to schedule tasks.

#### Periodic Task (`every()`)

```python
@scheduler.every('5s', log=True)
def periodic_task():
    print("This task runs every 5 seconds.")
```

#### Delayed Task (`after()`)

```python
@scheduler.after('10s', log=True)
def delayed_task():
    print("This task runs once after a 10-second delay.")
```

### Run Tasks

You can run tasks either blocking or non-blocking:

```python
scheduler.run(blocking=True)
```

### Task Control

You can pause, resume, stop, or edit tasks dynamically:

```python
# Pause task
scheduler.pause(periodic_task)

# Resume task
scheduler.resume(periodic_task)

# Stop task
scheduler.stop(periodic_task)

# Edit task properties
scheduler.edit(periodic_task, {'interval': '10s', 'log': True})
```

### Groups

Tasks can be organized into groups. You can run all tasks in a group:

```python
@scheduler.every('10s', group='group1')
def task_in_group():
    print("This task is part of 'group1'.")

# Running tasks in a group
scheduler.run(targets=['group1'])
```

## Task Properties

Each task has the following properties:

- `interval`: Time between executions (e.g., '5s', '1m').
- `delay`: Initial delay before starting the task (e.g., '2s').
- `jitter`: Optional random jitter applied to the interval or delay (e.g., '500ms').
- `limit`: The maximum number of executions (default is no limit).
- `log`: If True, logs task execution details to the console.
- `group`: Optional task group to organize related tasks.

## Example

```python
from taskforge import TaskForge

scheduler = TaskForge()

# Task 1: Run every 5 seconds
@scheduler.every('5s', log=True)
def task_1():
    print("Task 1 is running every 5 seconds.")

# Task 2: Run once after a 10-second delay
@scheduler.after('10s', log=True)
def task_2():
    print("Task 2 ran after a 10-second delay.")

# Run all tasks
scheduler.run()

# Pause and resume tasks
scheduler.pause(task_1)
scheduler.resume(task_1)

# Stop a task
scheduler.stop(task_2)
```

## TODO

- Implement **Timeouts** for task execution.
- **Priority** management for tasks.
- Support for **Groups** (already available for scheduling and running tasks).
